# 📊 Analysis of Eurostat Consumer Data

This project focuses on analyzing data from Eurostat, including household consumption expenditure and the consumer confidence indicator, to gain insights into consumption patterns and economic trends.

## 🚀 Introduction

This script performs the following steps:

1. Retrieves and filters data from Eurostat.
2. Calculates micro-indicators and real growth.
3. Analyzes and visualizes data to identify patterns and relationships.
